# esbuild-svelte

With the introduction of plugins coming to esbuild soon, there will be demand for a svelte plugin to automaticly resolve .svelte files. This plugin will be updated once plugin support is officially announced for esbuild. 

This original version is copied directly from Evan Wallace's example but will be modified to work in more circumstances in the future

## TODO
- Figure out CSS support
- Expose Svelte options
- Add more functionality
